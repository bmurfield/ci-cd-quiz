CI/CD Pipeline Integration for Fullstack Application
====================================================

Description
-----------

This project demonstrates the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** to automate testing and deployment processes for a fullstack web application. The pipeline ensures quality control through automated **Cypress component tests** and enables **automatic deployment** to Render upon successful merges to the `main` branch.

The purpose of this project is to provide a robust system for maintaining code integrity, ensuring consistent releases, and reducing manual intervention in the deployment process.

* * * * *

Features
--------

-   **Continuous Integration**:\
    Automated Cypress component tests run whenever a Pull Request is made to the `develop` branch.\
    This ensures that all code changes are tested before merging into the main codebase.

-   **Continuous Deployment**:\
    Code merged from the `develop` branch into the `main` branch triggers a GitHub Action that automatically deploys the updated application to Render.

-   **Quality Assurance**:\
    CI/CD practices are implemented to ensure smooth and error-free integration and deployment cycles.

User Stories
------------

-   **Continuous Integration**:\
    *As a developer looking to integrate a pipeline in a codebase for continuous integration and deployment, I want to create a GitHub Action that will follow best practices by running test cases when a Pull Request is made to the `develop` branch so that I can ensure that all code integrations are clean and pass the proper requirements.*

-   **Continuous Deployment**:\
    *As a developer looking to deploy the application automatically to Render when code is merged from `develop` to `main`, I want to create a GitHub Action that will run when the code is merged to `main` and automatically deploy to Render so that the application is constantly updated when major releases are made to the `main` branch.*

Acceptance Criteria
-------------------

1.  **Pull Requests to `develop`:**

    -   Pull Requests to the `develop` branch trigger a GitHub Action that runs Cypress component tests.
    -   Test results are displayed on GitHub Actions.
    -   Code is merged into `develop` only if all tests pass.
2.  **Merges to `main`:**

    -   Code merged from `develop` to `main` triggers a separate GitHub Action.
    -   The application is deployed automatically to Render.
3.  **Deployment Visibility:**

    -   Successful deployment to Render is confirmed after merging to `main`.

Project Setup
-------------

### Prerequisites

-   GitHub repository with the application code.
-   Cypress configured for component testing.
-   Render account for deployment.
-   GitHub Actions enabled in your repository.

### GitHub Actions Workflow Files

1.  **CI Workflow** (`ci.yml`):\
    This workflow runs Cypress component tests on Pull Requests to the `develop` branch.

    Example configuration:

    yaml

    Copy code

    `name: Cypress Tests
    on:
      pull_request:
        branches:
          - develop
    jobs:
      test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v3
          - name: Setup Node.js
            uses: actions/setup-node@v3
            with:
              node-version: '16'
          - name: Install dependencies
            run: npm install
          - name: Run Cypress tests
            run: npx cypress run`

2.  **CD Workflow** (`cd.yml`):\
    This workflow triggers deployment to Render when code is merged to `main`.

    Example configuration:

    yaml

    Copy code

    `name: Deploy to Render
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main
    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v3
          - name: Deploy to Render
            run: |
              # Replace with your deployment command or API call
              curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.RENDER_API_KEY }}"\
                -d "serviceId=<YOUR_RENDER_SERVICE_ID>"\
                "https://api.render.com/v1/services/<YOUR_RENDER_SERVICE_ID>/deploys" `

Conclusion
----------

This project showcases how CI/CD pipelines can streamline development workflows, ensure high code quality, and reduce deployment errors. By integrating automated tests and deployments, developers can focus more on writing code and less on managing the infrastructure.
